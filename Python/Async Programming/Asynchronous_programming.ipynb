    "* __Problem__: Cooking step by step waiting for each step to finish (_sync but slow process_)\n",
    "* __Solution 1__: Hire more people to work simultainusly (_costly_)\n",
    "* __Solution 2__: Interleave independent tasks i.e., perform another task while waiting for an independent task. (_Async_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing tasks asynchronously means _manage to perform multiple things at the same time not doing multiple things simultainusly_ (which is rather called concurrency or parallel processing); i.e., using a single cook efficiently than having multiple cook. \n",

    "## Rule of async in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Async code does not run itself__\n",
    "    * __Example 1__: Async functions have to be handed over to the Event Loop to run. They can't be called like regular python functions. \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        aysnc def func_1(args): # define async function\n",
    "            #something \n",
    "            await func_2()\n",
    "\n",
    "        func_1()  # warning: func_1 never awaited. \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * __Example 2__: The correct way, handing over the async function `func_1()` to an event loop offered by `asyncio`. This is not the only way but most preferred one. \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        import asyncio  # provides event loop\n",
    "\n",
    "        aysnc def func_1(args): # define async function\n",
    "            #something \n",
    "            await func_2()\n",
    "\n",
    "        asyncio.run(func_1())  # handing over to the event loop. \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "2. __Only async code can be awaited__\n",
    "    * __Example__: A function can only `await` if it's defined as `async`.\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        def func_1(args):\n",
    "            #something\n",
    "            await func2()   # error: await outside async function\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "3. __Awaiting a function does not magically make it async (the logic needs to be IO bound)__: In practice the callable APIs needs to be studied first, if it's a blockig API then find a non-blocking alternative (e.g., `aiohttp` in oppose to `request`). "
